    
SSHScript
#########
Many backend, DevOps, and SRE engineers have daily tasks that involve repetitive manual operations between the Linux console and SSH. When automation is needed, shell scripts are often used. Have you ever thought about solving this with Python scripts?

SSHScript is a solution for those who have such an idea.The goal of SSHScript is to simply automate manual operations. Achieve the same functionality as shell scripts with Python.It can also use all Python packages and threading features.

To achieve the goal, it is necessary to simplify the functions of Python for SSH connections, executing CLI programs and shell commands, and changing the execution identity (sudo).SSHScript has achieved these things.

Simple and Intuitive
====================
SSHScript adds dollar-syntax syntax sugar to Python, which allows you to write scripts that closely resemble the process of manually performing operations.
For example, here is a Python script with dollar-syntax that runs the hostname command on localhost, a remote server, and the server behind the remote server:

.. code-block:: python

    ## run "hostname" on localhost
    $hostname
    with $.connect('user@host1'):
        ## run "hostname" on host1
        $hostname 
        with $.connect('user@host2'):
                ## run "hostname" on host2, with is behind the host1
                $hostname

Install
=======

.. code-block:: 

    $ pip3 install sshscript
    ## or
    $ python3 -m pip install sshscript


SSHScript depends on the Paramiko library. In some cases, it has been reported that an older version (1.1.17) of SSHScript was incorrectly installed. If you encounter this problem, the workaround is to manually install Paramiko and then reinstall SSHScript.

.. code-block::

    ## check version
    $ sshscript --version

    ## It should be 2.0 or higher. If it is older version, eg. 1.*. You can try to do the following steps:
    
    $ pip3 uninstall sshscript
    $ pip3 install paramiko
    $ pip3 install sshscript
    

Examples
=============

An example of SSHScript dollar-syntax (v2.0):

.. code-block:: python

    ## filename: example.spy
    ## run: sshscript example.spy
    $hostname
    ## get output by $.stdout, $.stderr and $.exitcode
    print('localhost name is ', $.stdout.strip())
    ## get an interactive sudo console of locahost
    with $.sudo('password') as sudoconsole:
        sudoconsole('whoami')
        assert 'root' in sudoconsole.stdout
        sudoconsole('ls -l $HOME')

    ## connect to a remote host by ssh
    with $.connect('user1@host', 'password'):
        $hostname
        ## get output by $.stdout, $.stderr and $.exitcode
        print('remote name is ', $.stdout.strip())
        ## get an interactive sudo console of the remote host
        with $.sudo('password') as sudoconsole:
            sudoconsole('whoami')
            assert 'root' in sudoconsole.stdout
            sudoconsole('ls -l $HOME')
        ## connect to nested remote host
        with $.connect('user2@nestedhost', pkey=$.pkey('/home/user1/.ssh/id_rsa')):
            $hostname
            ## get output by $.stdout, $.stderr and $.exitcode
            print('nested remote name is ', $.stdout.strip())
            ## get an interactive sudo console of the nested remote host
            with $.sudo('password') as sudoconsole:
                sudoconsole('whoami')
                assert 'root' in sudoconsole.stdout
                sudoconsole('ls -l $HOME')


An example of SSHScript module(v2.0):

.. code-block:: python

    ## filename: example.py
    ## run: python3 example.py
    import sshscript
    from sshscript import SSHScriptSession
    session = SSHScriptSession()
    # Execute commands on localhost
    session('df')
    for line in session.stdout.split('\n'):
        cols = line.split()
        if len(cols)>5: print(f'ussage of {cols[0]} is {cols[4]}')
    ## connect to remote by ssh
    with session.connect('user1@host', 'password') as remote_session:
        # Execute commands on the remote host
        remote_session('df')
        for line in remote_session.stdout.split('\n'):
            cols = line.split()
            if len(cols)>5: print(f'ussage of {cols[0]} is {cols[4]}')
        with remote_session.connect('user2@nestedhost', pkey=remote_session.pkey('/home/user1/.ssh/id_rsa') as nested_remote_session:
            # Execute commands on the nested remote host
            nested_remote_session('df')
            for line in nested_remote_session.stdout.split('\n'):
                cols = line.split()
                if len(cols)>5: print(f'ussage of {cols[0]} is {cols[4]}')

Benefits of using SSHScript
============================

* Easy to use: SSHScript is easy to use, even for those with limited programming experience. It abstracts away the complexity of the subprocess and Paramiko modules, so you can focus on writing your scripts.

* Intuitive and self-explanatory: SSHScript uses a simple and intuitive syntax, making it easy to read and write your scripts. You can embed shell commands directly in your Python scripts, which makes your scripts more readable and self-explanatory.

* Unified interface: SSHScript provides an unified interface for interacting with both local and remote hosts. This makes it easy to write scripts that can be used to automate tasks on any type of host.

* Easier handling of outputs and exceptions: SSHScript makes it easy to handle the output and exceptions of your scripts. You can use Python's built-in data structures and exception handling mechanisms to write more robust and maintainable scripts.

* Pure Python: SSHScript is written in pure Python, which means that it can be easily integrated with other Python libraries and tools. This makes it easy to extend SSHScript with new features and functionality.

* Leverage the Python ecosystem: SSHScript scripts are pure Python, which means that they can leverage the vast ecosystem of Python packages. This gives you access to a wide range of tools and libraries for tasks such as data processing, machine learning, and web development.
